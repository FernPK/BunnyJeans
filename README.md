*There are still a few problems with the deployed website.

### Available functions

* filter by animal, color, availability (stock)
* add and remove from basket
* add and remove from wishlist
* show recently viewed

### Future plan
* filter by price
* sort items

This project originally fetches local JSON files but there is a problem when deploying. So I started to store data in MongoDB and write fastapi to get data. I'm going to design APIs and use them efficiently in the next step.
